# Master-TSI

This is a repository showcasing all my work during my Master's of Signal and Image Processing in Aix Marseille University, organised by subject. It mainly consists of practical exercises (TP) in python on Algorithms, Signal Processing and Image Processing. Each exercise contains a python script and a pdf document in french or english.
