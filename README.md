# Master-TSI

This is a repository showcasing all my work during my Master's of Signal and Image Processing in Aix Marseille University, organised by semester and subject. It mainly consists of practical exercises (TP) in python on Algorithms, Signal Processing and Image Processing, Data Science, Math and Geometric algorithms. Each exercise contains a python script and a pdf document in french or english.
